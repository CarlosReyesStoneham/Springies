#Design Goals and Adding Features#
This project has 4 fundamental pieces. The XML reader, the objects that
interact with each other, the environment, and the controls. Each of these
elements has a flagship class, that is, one class that is generally recommended
to be the super class of most of the objects that are going to be added in. For
example the class Controls is generally going to be the parent class of any child that
requires some sort of user input. In the same light, XMLReader is generally going to be
the parent class of anything that requires reading in XML, or asking for a user to select
a file.

#Resolving Ambiguity#
To increase the ease of access to files and reduce the effort of
searching for code, we have structured the source directory with
many packages that split up the code. Thus if one needs to make a 
change to the controls of the game they can simply go into the controls package.
Each file has also been labeled very clearly, following with this example
the controls package has a MouseClick class, which as it implies, controls what
happens when the mouse is clicked.

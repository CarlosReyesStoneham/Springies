Plan

1. Make classes for Spring and Mass objects. Both Spring and Mass should extend 
the Physical Object class.

2. The constructor for Spring should allow for two Mass objects, one for each end
of the spring. It should also have parameters that allow for the k value (springiness)
and the length of the spring.

3. The Mass class must take in starting coordinates, and forces in the x and y direction
as its parameters.

3. The XML reader class will read in an XML file, then it will create all of the mass
objects specified by the XML file under the "nodes" tag. It will then connect the nodes
together by reading in thr springs under the "links" tag, associating the two masses specified.
By doing this with every spring listed under the "links" tag, the masses and springs will become
interconnected to form objects as specified by the XML file.

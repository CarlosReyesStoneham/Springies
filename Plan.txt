Plan

Overview
	Make classes for Spring and Mass objects. Both Spring and Mass should extend 
	the Physical Object class.

Spring
	The constructor for Spring should allow for two Mass objects, one for each end
	of the spring. It should also have parameters that allow for the k value (springiness)
	and the length of the spring.

Mass
	The Mass class must take in starting coordinates, and forces in the x and y direction
	as its parameters.

Muscles
	Extends class Spring. Are springs that expand and contract, sinusoidal 
	(affected by spring stiffness).

Friction
	Affects speed of object movement

Vicosity
	Extends class Friction, essentially adds friction to the playing field,

XML
	The XML reader class will read in an XML file, then it will create all of the mass
	objects specified by the XML file under the "nodes" tag. It will then connect the nodes
	together by reading in thr springs under the "links" tag, associating the two masses specified.
	By doing this with every spring listed under the "links" tag, the masses and springs will become
	interconnected to form objects as specified by the XML file.
